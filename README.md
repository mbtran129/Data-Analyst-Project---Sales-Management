# SALES MANAGEMENT PROJECT

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1. Background
We had a business request from Steven - Sales Manager. Below is the email we received from him.
> *Hi!
I hope you are doing well. We need to improve our internet **sales reports** and want to move from static reports to **visual dashboards**.
Essentially, we want to focus it on how much we have **sold of what products**, to **which clients** and how **it has been over time**.
Seeing as each **salesperson** works on different products and customers it would be beneficial to be able to **filter them also**.
We measure our numbers against budget so I added that in a **spreadsheet** so we can compare our values against performance.
The budget is for 2021 and we usually look **2 years back** in time when we do analysis of sales.
Let me know if you need anything else!*
